# Interakt WhatsApp Business API Setup Guide

## Overview

Interakt is a WhatsApp Business API platform that helps Shopify stores connect with customers through WhatsApp. It allows businesses to send product catalogs, automate notifications, recover abandoned carts, and provide customer support directly through WhatsApp messages.

---

## What is Interakt?

Interakt is a software service that connects your Shopify store to WhatsApp Business API. Instead of customers only shopping on your website, they can browse products, ask questions, and complete purchases all through WhatsApp conversations. It's like having a sales assistant working 24/7 through WhatsApp.

The platform is owned by Jio Haptik Technologies and serves businesses in India, Singapore, Indonesia, Brazil, UAE, Philippines, and Africa. It's designed specifically for e-commerce stores that want to reach customers where they already spend time chatting with friends and family.

## Key Features

### Product Catalog Sharing
Send your entire Shopify product catalog to customers through WhatsApp. They can browse products, view images, see prices, and add items to cart without leaving the chat. Your products automatically sync from Shopify, so when you update prices or add new items, everything stays current in WhatsApp.

### Automated Order Notifications
Send automatic messages to customers when their order status changes. Customers receive alerts for order confirmations, shipping updates, when items are out for delivery, and when packages arrive. This reduces customer support tickets because people know exactly where their order is.

### Cart Recovery
When customers add items to their cart but don't complete checkout, Interakt automatically sends WhatsApp reminders. This helps recover sales that would otherwise be lost. The system tracks which customers abandoned carts and sends personalized messages to encourage them to finish their purchase.

### Team Inbox
Multiple team members can respond to customer messages from one shared inbox. This works like a customer support system where all WhatsApp conversations are organized in one place. Team members can see who's talking to which customer, assign conversations, and collaborate on solving customer issues.

### Chat Widgets
Add a WhatsApp button to your Shopify store website. When customers click it, they can start chatting with your team directly. This makes it easy for customers to ask questions while browsing your products without switching apps.

### Bulk Campaigns
Send marketing messages to large groups of customers at once. You can create campaigns for new product launches, special discounts, seasonal promotions, or announcements. Messages are sent automatically to your entire customer list or specific segments.

### Green Tick Verification
Interakt helps you apply for WhatsApp's official business verification badge. This green checkmark appears next to your business name in WhatsApp, showing customers that you're an official, verified business. This builds trust and credibility.

### Conversation Analytics
Track how well your team responds to customers. The system shows average response times, how quickly issues are resolved, customer satisfaction ratings, and how many conversations each team member handles. This helps you improve customer service quality.

## Use Cases

### E-commerce Stores
Online stores use Interakt to send product catalogs to customers who message them on WhatsApp. Instead of describing products over text, businesses can send interactive catalogs with images, prices, and descriptions. Customers can browse multiple products and add items to cart directly from WhatsApp.

### Restaurants and Food Businesses
Restaurants send menus through WhatsApp and allow customers to place orders via chat. Customers can see dish photos, prices, and descriptions. When orders are ready for pickup or delivery, restaurants send automatic notifications. This works especially well for food delivery services.

### Retail Stores
Clothing stores, electronics shops, and other retailers share product catalogs on WhatsApp. Sales teams can send personalized product recommendations based on customer preferences. Stores can notify customers about new arrivals, sales, or items back in stock.

### Service Businesses
Salons, spas, and appointment-based businesses use Interakt to send booking confirmations, reminders, and follow-up messages. Customers receive WhatsApp notifications about their upcoming appointments and can reschedule or cancel through chat.

### B2B Sales
Companies selling to other businesses use Interakt to send product catalogs, quotes, and proposals through WhatsApp. Sales teams can share pricing information, product specifications, and handle negotiations all within WhatsApp conversations.

## Real-World Examples

### Fashion Retailer
A clothing store uses Interakt to send seasonal catalogs to their customer list. When customers message asking about specific items, the store sends product catalogs showing available sizes, colors, and prices. Customers can browse multiple items, add favorites to cart, and complete checkout without leaving WhatsApp. The store recovers 60% of abandoned carts through WhatsApp reminders.

### Electronics Store
An electronics shop shares product catalogs with customers who inquire about items. Sales staff can send multiple product options, compare features, and answer questions through WhatsApp. When items go on sale, the store sends bulk campaign messages to notify customers. Order confirmations and shipping updates are sent automatically.

### Food Delivery Service
A restaurant sends their menu through WhatsApp to customers who want to order. Customers browse dishes, see photos, and place orders via chat. The restaurant sends automatic notifications when orders are confirmed, when food is being prepared, when it's out for delivery, and when it arrives. This reduces phone calls and speeds up the ordering process.

### Beauty Salon
A salon uses Interakt to send appointment confirmations and reminders through WhatsApp. Customers receive messages 24 hours before their appointment with service details and location information. After appointments, customers receive follow-up messages asking about their experience and offering special promotions for their next visit.

## Limitations

### Regional Availability
Interakt primarily serves businesses in India, Singapore, Indonesia, Brazil, UAE, Philippines, and Africa. Businesses in other regions may have limited support or need to verify availability before signing up.

WhatsApp Business API has rate limits on how many messages you can send. While Interakt's Advanced plan allows 600 messages per minute, smaller plans have lower limits. High-volume businesses may need to upgrade plans.

### Template Message Requirements
WhatsApp requires businesses to use pre-approved message templates for most communications. Creating and getting templates approved can take time, and you can't send arbitrary messages to customers immediately.
