# Microsoft's Official Solution for React/Vite Projects

## üéØ **From Microsoft's VS Code Live Preview Repository**

Based on the [official Microsoft repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-livepreview), here's the definitive solution:

### **Why Live Preview Doesn't Work for Your Project**

1. **Extension Status**: Still under development (‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING)
2. **Project Type**: Designed for static HTML files, not React/Vite
3. **Microsoft's Own Words**: *"This extension is most useful for projects where a server is not already created (e.g. not for apps using React, Angular, etc.)"*

### **Microsoft's Official Recommendation**

Microsoft specifically states: *"To work with these, feel free to run the `Simple Browser: Show` command that is already built-in with VS Code."*

## üöÄ **Step-by-Step Solution (From Microsoft's Documentation)**

### **Method 1: Simple Browser (Microsoft's Recommendation)**
1. **Open Command Palette**: `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac)
2. **Type**: `Simple Browser: Show`
3. **Enter URL**: `http://localhost:8081`
4. **Press Enter**

### **Method 2: Alternative Commands to Try**
- `Simple Browser: Open`
- `Simple Browser: New Window`
- `Simple Browser: Focus`

## üé® **What You'll See**

- ‚úÖ **Skybox Gamehub** with your new orange and green color scheme
- ‚úÖ **Vibrant Orange Primary**: `#FF6B35` for buttons and navigation
- ‚úÖ **Sophisticated Green Accent**: `#2D7A3D` for secondary actions
- ‚úÖ **Live Reload**: Changes appear instantly as you edit
- ‚úÖ **Full Functionality**: All routes and features working

## üìã **Why This is the Correct Solution**

1. **Official Microsoft Recommendation**: This is Microsoft's own suggested solution
2. **Built-in Feature**: Simple Browser is part of VS Code/Cursor
3. **React/Vite Compatible**: Designed for modern web frameworks
4. **No Extension Issues**: No compatibility problems with Cursor IDE

## üåê **Your App is Ready**

- **URL**: `http://localhost:8081`
- **Development Server**: Running and ready
- **Color Scheme**: New orange and green palette active
- **Live Reload**: Automatic refresh on changes
