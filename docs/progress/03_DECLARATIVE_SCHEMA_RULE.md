## 🎯 What This Rule Covers

### ✅ Exclusive Declarative Schema Approach
- All schema in `supabase/schemas/` directory
- Auto-generated migrations (never manual edits)
- Clear separation of concerns
- Version-controlled schema definitions

### ✅ Schema Declaration Standards
- File location and naming conventions
- Numeric prefixes for execution order (01_, 02_, etc.)
- Complete entity definitions
- Dependency management

### ✅ Migration Generation Workflow
- **Step 1:** Stop Supabase before diffing
- **Step 2:** Generate migrations with `supabase db diff`
- **Step 3:** Review generated migrations carefully
- **Step 4:** Apply and test locally
- **Step 5:** Deploy to production

### ✅ Schema Organization & Dependencies
- Dependency graphs for table creation order
- Foreign key management
- Table execution order strategies
- Column addition patterns

### ✅ Rollback Procedures
- Reverting schema changes safely
- Data-only rollbacks (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- Testing rollback procedures
- Verification steps

### ✅ Known Caveats & Limitations
- DML statements (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) not auto-tracked
- View ownership and permissions
- RLS policy modifications (ALTER POLICY)
- Schema privileges and comments
- Manual migration solutions

### ✅ Complete Workflow Example
- Step-by-step schema changes
- Real SQL code examples
- Command sequences
- Verification procedures

## 🔐 Mandatory Compliance

### Critical Rules
```
⚠️  MANDATORY - Non-compliance leads to:
    ✗ Inconsistent database states
    ✗ Lost schema history
    ✗ Deployment failures
    ✗ Data integrity issues
```

### Compliance Checklist
- [ ] All schema in `supabase/schemas/` directory
- [ ] Never manually edit `supabase/migrations/` files
- [ ] Stop Supabase before running `supabase db diff`
- [ ] Review generated migrations before applying
- [ ] Test migrations locally first
- [ ] Handle known caveats appropriately
- [ ] Use numeric prefixes for file ordering

## 📊 Key Concepts

### Declarative vs Imperative

**✅ DECLARATIVE (Correct Approach)**
```
1. Edit: supabase/schemas/03_games.sql
2. Define: Complete final table state
3. Run: supabase db diff -f add_column
4. Review: supabase/migrations/TIMESTAMP_add_column.sql
5. Apply: supabase start
```

**❌ IMPERATIVE (Incorrect - Prohibited)**
```
1. Manually write: supabase/migrations/...sql
2. Write: ALTER TABLE statement
3. Apply: Directly run migration
4. Skip: Schema declaration
```

### Table Execution Order

```
01_extensions.sql (if needed)
    ↓
02_enums.sql (custom types)
    ↓
03_leagues.sql (no dependencies)
    ↓
04_teams.sql (foreign key → leagues)
    ↓
05_games.sql (foreign keys → teams, leagues)
    ↓
06_users.sql (no dependencies)
    ↓
07_reservations.sql (foreign keys → users, games)
    ↓
08_functions.sql (operate on tables)
    ↓
09_triggers.sql (reference functions)
```

---

## 🚀 Workflow Commands

### Stop Environment
```bash
supabase stop
```

### Declare Schema
```bash
vim supabase/schemas/03_games.sql
# Edit complete entity definition
```

### Generate Migration
```bash
supabase db diff -f add_broadcast_url_column
# Creates: supabase/migrations/TIMESTAMP_add_broadcast_url_column.sql
```

### Start Environment
```bash
supabase start
```

### Verify Schema
```bash
supabase db pull
# Compare with schema declarations
```

### Test Migration
```bash
supabase migration test
```

## 💡 Key Rules

### File Naming
- Use **numeric prefixes** (01_, 02_, etc.)
- Order by **dependencies**, not alphabetically
- Names should be **descriptive** (e.g., `03_games.sql`)

### Column Addition
- **Always append** new columns to end of table
- Never insert in middle of column definitions
- Minimizes unnecessary diffs

### Known Caveats - Workarounds

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| DML not tracked | Add manually to migrations |
| View ownership | Create views in migrations |
| RLS policy changes | Drop and recreate in schema |
| Schema privileges | Write migrations manually |
| Comments | Add manually to migrations |

## 🎓 When This Rule Applies

Cursor automatically applies this rule when:
- ✅ Working on `supabase/schemas/*.sql` files
- ✅ Reviewing `supabase/migrations/*.sql` files
- ✅ Discussing database schema changes
- ✅ Creating new tables or columns

---

## 📚 Integration with Other Rules

Works alongside these existing rules:

| Rule | Integration |
|------|-------------|
| `create-db-functions.mdc` | Functions defined in schemas/ |
| `create-migration.mdc` | Migration standards & naming |
| `create-rls-policies.mdc` | RLS policies in schemas/ |
| `postgres-sql-style-guide.mdc` | SQL formatting in schemas/ |

---

## ✨ Best Practices

### DO ✅
- Keep schema files in `supabase/schemas/`
- Use numeric prefixes for execution order
- Declare complete final state in schema files
- Stop Supabase before running `db diff`
- Review generated migrations carefully
- Test migrations locally first
- Use descriptive migration names
- Append new columns to end of definitions

### DON'T ❌
- Manually edit migration files
- Use migrations for schema (use schema declarations)
- Run `db diff` while Supabase is running
- Modify schema files incrementally
- Insert columns in middle of definitions
- Forget to handle known caveats
- Deploy untested migrations

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Migration doesn't capture all changes
- Verify schema files have complete definitions
- Check file naming order (01_, 02_, etc.)
- Ensure Supabase stopped before `db diff`
- Check for known caveats (RLS, views, etc.)

### Diff shows unexpected changes
- Review schema files for modifications
- Check existing database state: `supabase db pull`
- Verify column order and types

### RLS policies not in migration
- RLS policies may not be fully tracked
- Manually add to schema file or migration
- Test policies after applying migration

### Foreign key constraints failing
- Check table execution order
- Ensure referenced tables exist first
- Verify ON DELETE/ON UPDATE clauses

## 📖 Complete Example Workflow

### 1. Declare Schema
```sql
-- supabase/schemas/03_games.sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.games (
  id BIGINT GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  league_id BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES public.leagues(id),
  home_team_id BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES public.teams(id),
  away_team_id BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES public.teams(id),
  game_datetime TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'scheduled',
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_games_datetime ON public.games(game_datetime);
ALTER TABLE public.games ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### 2. Generate Migration
```bash
supabase stop
supabase db diff -f create_games_table
```

### 3. Review Migration
```bash
cat supabase/migrations/20241023143000_create_games_table.sql
# Verify all expected SQL is present
```

### 4. Apply & Test
```bash
supabase start
supabase db pull
# Test in dashboard
```

### 5. Add Column Later
```sql
-- Update supabase/schemas/03_games.sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.games (
  -- ... existing columns ...
  broadcast_url TEXT,  -- NEW - at end
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

```bash
supabase stop
supabase db diff -f add_broadcast_url
supabase start
```
