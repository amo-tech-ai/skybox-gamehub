# Fix Lint Errors

You are a helpful code quality assistant. Your job is to:

1. **Run ESLint** to find all linting errors and warnings
2. **List all issues** in a clear, numbered format
3. **Propose fixes** one issue at a time
4. **Apply fixes** only after user confirms each one
5. **Re-run linting** after each fix to verify
6. **Report summary** at the end

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Run ESLint
```bash
npm run lint
```

Capture all errors and warnings. Group them by:
- **Errors** (must fix)
- **Warnings** (should fix)
- **File location** (group by file for context)

### Step 2: Present Issues
Show each issue with:
- File path and line number
- Error/warning message
- Code snippet showing the problem
- Suggested fix

Example format:
```
🔴 ERROR #1: Unused variable
File: src/pages/Home.tsx:25
Issue: 'selectedDate' is assigned but never used
Code:
  23 | const Home = () => {
  24 |   const [events, setEvents] = useState([]);
> 25 |   const [selectedDate, setSelectedDate] = useState(null);
     |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^
  26 |   return <div>...</div>;

Suggested Fix: Remove unused variable
```

### Step 3: Fix One at a Time
For each issue:
1. Ask: "Should I fix this issue? (yes/no/skip)"
2. If yes, apply the fix using Edit tool
3. Show the diff of what changed
4. Re-run `npm run lint` to verify fix worked
5. Move to next issue

### Step 4: Auto-fixable Issues
Some ESLint errors can be auto-fixed:
```bash
npm run lint -- --fix
```

Ask first: "I found X auto-fixable issues. Run auto-fix? (yes/no)"

### Step 5: Summary Report
After all fixes, report:
- Total issues found
- Issues fixed
- Issues remaining
- Files modified

Example:
```
✅ Lint Fixes Complete

📊 Summary:
- Total issues: 15
- Fixed: 12 ✅
- Remaining: 3 ⚠️
- Files modified: 5

🟢 Errors: 0
🟡 Warnings: 3 (non-critical)

Files changed:
- src/pages/Home.tsx (4 fixes)
- src/components/EventCard.tsx (3 fixes)
- src/hooks/useEvents.ts (5 fixes)
```

## Safety Rules

1. **Never** modify logic without explicit approval
2. **Always** show diffs before applying changes
3. **Stop** if unsure about a fix and ask for guidance
4. **Preserve** functionality - only fix style/syntax issues
5. **Test** after major changes (offer to run `npm run build`)

## Common Fixes

### Unused Variables
```typescript
// Before
const [data, setData] = useState(null);

// After (if truly unused)
// Remove the line entirely
```

### Missing Dependencies in useEffect
```typescript
// Before
useEffect(() => {
  fetchData(userId);
}, []);

// After
useEffect(() => {
  fetchData(userId);
}, [userId]);
```

### No-Explicit-Any
```typescript
// Before
const handleClick = (e: any) => {};

// After
const handleClick = (e: React.MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement>) => {};
```

### React Hooks Rules
```typescript
// Before
if (condition) {
  useEffect(() => {}, []);  // ❌ Hook in conditional
}

// After
useEffect(() => {
  if (condition) {
    // logic here
  }
}, [condition]);  // ✅ Hook at top level
```

## When to Stop

Stop and ask for help if:
- Fix requires architectural changes
- Issue is in generated/vendor code
- Uncertain about correct TypeScript type
- Fix might break functionality
- More than 20 issues to fix (batch into multiple sessions)

## Example Usage

User runs: `/fix-lint-errors`

Expected flow:
1. Run `npm run lint`
2. "Found 8 issues: 5 errors, 3 warnings"
3. List all issues grouped by file
4. "Start fixing issues? (yes/no)"
5. Fix issues one-by-one with approval
6. Re-run lint after each fix
7. Final summary report

**Goal:** Clean codebase with zero lint errors, safely and incrementally.
