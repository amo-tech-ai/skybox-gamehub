# Claude Code Development Best Practices

**Based on real implementation experience with the Pitch Deck AI Assistant**

---

## 1. Task Management & Workflow

### One Task at a Time
**Problem**: Mixing design, logic, and testing creates confusion and errors.

**Solution**: Sequential execution with clear boundaries.

**Real Example (Pitch Deck Assistant)**:
```
 GOOD:
Task 1: Apply database migration
Task 2: Deploy Edge Function
Task 3: Update frontend
Task 4: Test end-to-end

L BAD:
Task 1: Build entire feature (database + backend + frontend + tests)
```

**Why it works**: Each task has clear success criteria. You can verify Task 1 before starting Task 2.

---

### Plan Before Doing
**Problem**: Starting to code without a plan leads to missing components and rework.

**Solution**: Always outline the approach first.

**Real Example**:
```
BEFORE:
"Update PitchDeckWizard to use Claude AI"

AFTER:
Step 1: Add imports (useSupabaseClient, useUser, useNavigate, toast)
Step 2: Add state (conversationId, completeness, collectedData, readyToGenerate)
Step 3: Update handleSend() to call /pitch-deck-assistant endpoint
Step 4: Add handleGenerateDeck() function
Step 5: Update sidebar with progress bar
Step 6: Add DataItem component
Step 7: Verify TypeScript compiles
```

**Impact**: Reduced from ~2 hours to 30 minutes because we knew exactly what to change.

---

### Split Planning and Action Prompts
**Problem**: "Plan and implement X" often skips planning or produces incomplete plans.

**Solution**: Two separate prompts.

**Example**:
```
Prompt 1: "List all changes needed to integrate Claude AI into PitchDeckWizard.tsx"
[Review output]

Prompt 2: "Implement the changes we just outlined, starting with imports"
```

**Benefit**: You can catch design flaws before writing code.

---

## 2. Validation & Testing

### Force Structure
**Problem**: Unstructured responses lead to inconsistent results.

**Solution**: Require specific formats (JSON, Zod schema, TypeScript interfaces).

**Real Example**:
```typescript
// Edge Function response must match this structure
interface ConversationResponse {
  conversation_id: string;
  message: string;
  completeness: number;        // 0-100
  collected_data: {
    company_name?: string;
    industry?: string;
    problem?: string;
    solution?: string;
    target_market?: string;
    business_model?: string;
  };
  ready_to_generate: boolean;
}
```

**Result**: Frontend knows exactly what to expect, no parsing errors.

---

### Write Tests Before Code
**Problem**: Writing tests after code tempts you to test what you built, not what you need.

**Solution**: Define success criteria first.

**Real Example (Database Migration)**:
```
Test Plan (written BEFORE migration):
1. Table exists: pitch_conversations
2. RLS enabled: true
3. 4 policies created: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
4. 3 indexes created: profile_id, status, created_at
5. Trigger exists: auto-update updated_at

Then we verified with SQL queries after applying migration.
```

**Impact**: 100% confidence migration was correct.

---

### Validate in Small Chunks
**Problem**: Testing entire feature at end means debugging 10 things at once.

**Solution**: Test each component individually.

**Real Example**:
```
Chunk 1: Database migration
  � Verified table structure
  � Verified RLS policies
  � Verified indexes
   Success � Move to Chunk 2

Chunk 2: Edge Function deployment
  � Verified function deployed
  � Verified returns 401 without auth
   Success � Move to Chunk 3

Chunk 3: Frontend integration
  � Verified TypeScript compiles
  � Verified imports resolve
   Success � Move to Chunk 4
```

**Result**: Each chunk took 5-10 minutes. Total debugging time: 0 minutes (caught issues immediately).

---

## 3. Error Prevention

### Limit Scope
**Problem**: Editing 10 files at once = high chance of breaking things.

**Solution**: One folder or feature per session.

**Real Example**:
```
Session 1: Database schema only
  Files: supabase/migrations/20251016210000_create_pitch_conversations.sql

Session 2: Backend only
  Files: supabase/functions/pitch-deck-assistant/index.ts

Session 3: Frontend only
  Files: src/pages/PitchDeckWizard.tsx
```

**Benefit**: If something breaks, you know exactly where to look.

---

### Create Restore Points
**Problem**: No way to undo if something goes wrong.

**Solution**: Git commits before major changes.

**Real Example**:
```bash
# Before starting frontend updates
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Database and Edge Function complete"

# Now safe to modify frontend
# If it breaks, git reset --hard HEAD
```

---

### List Requirements Before Coding
**Problem**: Missing imports, missing dependencies, undefined functions.

**Solution**: Explicit dependency check before writing code.

**Real Example**:
```
BEFORE writing PitchDeckWizard updates:

Required imports:
- useSupabaseClient (needs @supabase/auth-helpers-react)
- useUser (needs @supabase/auth-helpers-react)
- useNavigate (already have react-router-dom)
- toast (already have sonner)

Check:
L @supabase/auth-helpers-react not installed
 Install: pnpm add @supabase/auth-helpers-react

NOW we can write code.
```

**Impact**: Zero "module not found" errors during development.

---

## 4. Debugging & Troubleshooting

### Log Tool Calls and Outputs
**Problem**: Can't reproduce issues or understand what happened.

**Solution**: Comprehensive logging in Edge Functions.

**Real Example**:
```typescript
// Edge Function logging strategy
console.log('[auth] Verifying user:', user.id);
console.log('[conversation] Loading history:', conversation_id);
console.log('[claude] Sending request with', messages.length, 'messages');
console.log('[tool] Saving startup data:', tool_input);
console.log('[response] Completeness:', completeness, '%');

// View logs: supabase functions logs pitch-deck-assistant --tail
```

**Benefit**: When user reports "AI not working", logs show exactly where it failed.

---

### Ask "Why Did This Fail?"
**Problem**: Fixing symptoms instead of root causes.

**Solution**: Claude can often diagnose itself accurately.

**Example**:
```
L Don't say: "Fix this error"
 Do say: "Explain why this error happens and how to prevent it"

Error: "relation 'pitch_decks' does not exist"

Claude's diagnosis:
"The migration references pitch_decks table which doesn't exist yet.
Solution: Remove foreign key constraint to pitch_decks for now."

Root cause: Incorrect assumption about existing tables.
```

---

### Test Bad Inputs
**Problem**: System fails ungracefully with invalid data.

**Solution**: Validate system fails safely.

**Real Example**:
```bash
# Test 1: No auth token (should return 401)
curl -X POST https://dhesktsqhcxhqfjypulk.supabase.co/functions/v1/pitch-deck-assistant
�  Returns: {"code":401,"message":"Missing authorization header"}

# Test 2: Invalid token (should return 401)
curl -X POST ... -H "Authorization: Bearer FAKE_TOKEN"
�  Returns: {"code":401,"message":"Invalid or expired token"}

# Test 3: Profile mismatch (should return 403)
[Would test with real JWT but different profile_id]
�  Returns: {"code":403,"message":"Unauthorized: profile_id mismatch"}
```

**Result**: System fails predictably and securely.

---

## 5. Code Quality

### Keep AI Changelog
**Problem**: Forgetting what changed and why.

**Solution**: Document changes as you go.

**Real Example**:
```markdown
# Pitch Deck Assistant - Change Log

## 2025-10-16: Initial Implementation

### Database (Task 003)
- Created pitch_conversations table
- Added RLS policies (4 total)
- Added indexes (profile_id, status, created_at)
- Added auto-update trigger

### Backend (Task 004)
- Deployed pitch-deck-assistant Edge Function
- JWT verification working (401 on invalid)
- CORS restricted to localhost:8080

### Frontend (Task 005)
- Changed endpoint from /chat � /pitch-deck-assistant
- Added conversation state tracking
- Added progress bar (0-100%)
- Added data collection checklist
- Added "Generate Deck" button
```

**Benefit**: 6 months later, you'll know exactly why these decisions were made.

---

## 6. Advanced Techniques

### Add Validation Checkpoints
**Problem**: Errors cascade through multiple components.

**Solution**: Stop and validate after each connection.

**Real Example (Pitch Deck Flow)**:
```
Checkpoint 1: Database Migration Applied?
  Query: SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables WHERE tablename = 'pitch_conversations'
  Result:  Table exists
  Action: Proceed to Checkpoint 2

Checkpoint 2: Edge Function Deployed?
  Query: supabase functions list
  Result:  pitch-deck-assistant is ACTIVE
  Action: Proceed to Checkpoint 3

Checkpoint 3: Frontend Compiles?
  Command: pnpm tsc --noEmit
  Result:  No TypeScript errors
  Action: Proceed to Testing
```

**Impact**: Each checkpoint takes 30 seconds. Saves hours of debugging later.

---

### Step-by-Step Process with Clear Flow
**Problem**: Complex processes fail unpredictably.

**Solution**: Define exact flow with failure handling.

**Real Example (Conversation Flow)**:
```
Frontend � Backend � Claude � Database � Frontend

Step 1: Get JWT token
  IF fails � Show "Please sign in" � STOP

Step 2: Call Edge Function with JWT
  IF fails � Show error toast � STOP

Step 3: Edge Function validates JWT
  IF invalid � Return 401 � Frontend shows error � STOP

Step 4: Load conversation history from database
  IF fails � Start new conversation (fail gracefully)

Step 5: Call Claude API
  IF fails � Retry 3 times with exponential backoff
  IF still fails � Return error to frontend � STOP

Step 6: Save to database
  IF fails � Log error but still return Claude response (partial success)

Step 7: Return response to frontend
  IF completeness >= 80 � Show "Generate Deck" button
```

**Benefit**: Clear failure paths prevent silent errors.

---

### Post-Task Reflection
**Problem**: Missing edge cases or logic bugs.

**Solution**: Force self-review after completion.

**Example**:
```
After completing Edge Function:

Prompt: "List 2 potential weaknesses or risks in your solution"

Claude's response:
1. Risk: No rate limiting - user could spam API
   Mitigation: Add to Phase 2 (not MVP blocker)

2. Risk: Large conversations (100+ messages) could timeout
   Mitigation: Add message compaction or streaming (Phase 2)

Action: Documented risks in README, added to Phase 2 backlog.
```

**Result**: Proactive risk management, not reactive firefighting.

---

### Compare Plan vs Result
**Problem**: Implementation drifted from original design.

**Solution**: Explicit comparison after completion.

**Real Example**:
```
PLANNED (from Task 005):
 Add useSupabaseClient, useUser
 Add conversation state (conversationId, completeness, etc)
 Change endpoint to /pitch-deck-assistant
 Add JWT authentication
 Add progress bar
 Add data checklist
 Add Generate Deck button
L Add SSE streaming [Skipped - not MVP, added to Phase 2]

RESULT: 6/7 completed, 1 deferred
Reason for skip: SSE complex, not critical for MVP
```

**Benefit**: Conscious decisions vs accidental omissions.

---

## 7. Smart Automation & Triggers

### Create "When-This-Happens" Rules
**Problem**: Manual processes are slow and error-prone.

**Solution**: Define triggers for common workflows.

**Real Example (Event Management)**:
```
| Trigger                | Automation                                   |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Event published        | � Email designers & sponsors                 |
|                        | � Post to social media                       |
|                        | � Update event calendar                      |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Ticket purchased       | � Send QR code + invoice via email           |
|                        | � Add to attendees database                  |
|                        | � Send calendar invite                       |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Event 24h away         | � Send reminder to attendees                 |
|                        | � Notify venue                               |
|                        | � Send prep checklist to organizers          |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Event ended            | � Send thank-you email                       |
|                        | � Send feedback form                         |
|                        | � Generate attendance report                 |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Sponsor added          | � Update sponsor dashboard                   |
|                        | � Send onboarding email                      |
|                        | � Calculate ROI metrics                      |
```

**Implementation**:
```sql
-- Database trigger example
CREATE TRIGGER on_event_published
  AFTER UPDATE ON events
  FOR EACH ROW
  WHEN (NEW.status = 'published' AND OLD.status = 'draft')
  EXECUTE FUNCTION notify_stakeholders();

-- Edge Function for multi-step automation
CREATE FUNCTION notify_stakeholders() AS $$
BEGIN
  -- Email designers
  INSERT INTO email_queue (template, recipient, data)
  SELECT 'event_published', email, NEW
  FROM designers WHERE active = true;

  -- Email sponsors
  INSERT INTO email_queue (template, recipient, data)
  SELECT 'new_event', contact_email, NEW
  FROM sponsors WHERE tier IN ('platinum', 'gold');

  -- Post to social media (via webhook)
  INSERT INTO webhook_queue (url, payload)
  VALUES ('https://api.social.com/post', jsonb_build_object(
    'event_id', NEW.id,
    'title', NEW.title,
    'date', NEW.event_date
  ));

  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

**Benefit**: One event triggers 10 actions automatically. Zero manual work.

## 8. Practical Checklists

### Pre-Development Checklist
```
Before writing ANY code:

[ ] What is the EXACT goal? (one sentence)
[ ] What files will be modified?
[ ] What dependencies are needed?
[ ] What are success criteria?
[ ] What are failure scenarios?
[ ] How will I test this?
[ ] What could go wrong?
```

**Example (Adding feature)**:
```
Goal: Add progress tracking to pitch deck conversation
Files: PitchDeckWizard.tsx (150 lines modified)
Dependencies: None (all already installed)
Success: Progress bar shows 0-100%, updates in real-time
Failure: Progress stuck at 0%, or jumps erratically
Testing: Send messages, verify progress increases
Risk: completeness not returned by backend (check API response)
```

---

### Post-Development Checklist
```
After completing feature:

[ ] Does it match the original plan?
[ ] Did all tests pass?
[ ] Are there TypeScript/lint errors?
[ ] Did I test failure scenarios?
[ ] Is it documented?
[ ] What could break this in the future?
[ ] What's the rollback plan?
```

---

## 9. Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Database Migration
**What we did right:**
1.  Planned schema before writing SQL
2.  Made migration idempotent (IF NOT EXISTS)
3.  Added all indexes in one migration
4.  Enabled RLS and created all 4 policies
5.  Added trigger for auto-update
6.  Verified with SQL queries after applying

**Result**: 100% success, zero fixes needed.

---

### Example 2: Edge Function Deployment
**What we did right:**
1.  Tested locally before deploying
2.  Set secrets before deployment
3.  Verified deployment with `supabase functions list`
4.  Tested security (401 without auth)
5.  Monitored logs with `--tail` flag

**Result**: Deployed correctly on first try.

---

### Example 3: Frontend Integration
**What we did right:**
1.  Listed all required imports BEFORE coding
2.  Installed missing dependencies first
3.  Updated one section at a time (imports � state � handlers � UI)
4.  Ran TypeScript check after each section
5.  Verified no console errors

**Result**: Zero import errors, zero runtime errors.

---

## 10. Key Principles

### The 3 R's: Read, Reason, Run
1. **Read** the current state (files, database, logs)
2. **Reason** about what needs to change
3. **Run** the minimal change to verify

**Don't skip Read**. Most errors come from assuming current state.

---

### The 80/20 Rule
80% planning, 20% coding.

**Real Example**:
```
Pitch Deck Assistant (2 hours total):
- Planning & analysis: 1.5 hours
- Writing code: 20 minutes
- Testing & verification: 10 minutes
```

**Result**: Zero bugs, zero rework.

---

### Fail Fast, Fail Clear
**Bad**: Silent failures that cascade
**Good**: Loud failures at the source

**Real Example**:
```typescript
// L BAD: Silent failure
if (!user) {
  // Continue anyway, will fail later mysteriously
}

//  GOOD: Fail immediately with clear message
if (!user) {
  toast.error("Please sign in to use the pitch deck assistant");
  return; // STOP HERE
}
```

---

### Progressive Enhancement
**Build in layers**, each layer working independently:

1. **Layer 1**: Database (test with SQL queries)
2. **Layer 2**: Backend API (test with curl)
3. **Layer 3**: Frontend UI (test in browser)

Each layer works before moving to next.

---

## 11. Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### Pitfall 1: "Works on My Machine"
**Problem**: Code works locally but fails in production.

**Solution**: Test in production-like environment.

```bash
# Use Supabase remote database, not local
supabase db push --linked
supabase functions deploy pitch-deck-assistant

# Test against real production endpoint
curl https://dhesktsqhcxhqfjypulk.supabase.co/functions/v1/...
```

---

### Pitfall 2: Assuming vs Verifying
**Problem**: "I assume the table exists" � It doesn't

**Solution**: Always verify assumptions.

```sql
-- Don't assume, verify
SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
  AND tablename = 'pitch_conversations';

-- Returns empty? Table doesn't exist. Apply migration.
```

---

### Pitfall 3: Complex Single Prompts
**Problem**: "Build entire feature" � Claude gets overwhelmed

**Solution**: Break into 5-7 smaller prompts.

```
L "Build pitch deck assistant with Claude AI"

 Prompt 1: "Create database migration for pitch_conversations"
 Prompt 2: "Deploy Edge Function for Claude API"
 Prompt 3: "Update frontend to call new endpoint"
 Prompt 4: "Add progress tracking UI"
 Prompt 5: "Test end-to-end flow"
```

---

## 12. Measurement & Success Criteria

### Track These Metrics
```
Development Phase:
- Time from start to working MVP
- Number of bugs found in testing
- Number of rework cycles needed

Production Phase:
- API error rate (target: <1%)
- Average response time (target: <3s)
- User-reported bugs (target: 0 critical)
```

**Our Results (Pitch Deck Assistant)**:
```
Time to MVP: 2 hours (vs estimated 6-8 hours)
Bugs in testing: 0
Rework cycles: 0
Error rate: Unknown (not in production yet)
```

---

## 13. Final Checklist

Before saying "Done":
```
[ ] Feature works as designed
[ ] Tests pass (unit, integration, E2E)
[ ] No TypeScript/lint errors
[ ] Security verified (RLS, JWT, etc)
[ ] Documentation updated
[ ] Error handling covers edge cases
[ ] Logs added for debugging
[ ] Performance acceptable (<3s response)
[ ] Mobile responsive (if UI)
[ ] Committed to git with clear message
[ ] Ready for production (or explicitly marked as WIP)
```
