### 🧠 Prompt: Claude Memory Tool — Setup & When to Use

**Goal:**
Explain and show how to **set up the Memory Tool** in Claude, when to use it, and how it works together with **context editing** for long-running agents.

**Sources:**

* [https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/memory-tool](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/memory-tool)
* [https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/context-editing](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/context-editing)

**Instructions:**
Create a short guide that covers:

1. **What the Memory Tool does (simple terms)**

   * Store and retrieve data across sessions using `/memories` folder.
   * Acts like a “long-term notebook” for Claude.
   * Runs entirely client-side — developers control storage and security.

2. **When to use it**

   * For long or multi-session workflows (coding, data analysis, research).
   * When context gets too large but key details must persist.
   * When you want Claude to “remember” project progress or patterns between sessions.

3. **Example setup**

   * Show how to enable the tool with the beta header `context-management-2025-06-27`.
   * Add the tool to the API request as:

     ```json
     "tools": [{ "type": "memory_20250818", "name": "memory" }]
     ```
   * Use Python or TypeScript code examples to demonstrate `create`, `view`, and `str_replace` commands.

4. **Combine with Context Editing**

   * Explain how Claude clears old data automatically while saving key information to memory files.
   * Example use case:

     > “Claude summarizes a completed code review to `/memories/review_progress.md` before clearing old results.”

5. **Security and best practices (short list)**

   * Only allow operations inside `/memories`.
   * Block `../` or path traversal patterns.
   * Don’t store passwords, keys, or personal info.

6. **Real-world examples**

   * 🧑‍💻 *Coding*: Claude remembers bug fixes and architecture notes across sessions.
   * 🧾 *EventOS*: Keeps track of event tasks and sponsor feedback between updates.
   * 📚 *Research*: Stores summaries and sources for cross-session learning.

7. **Output format:**

   * Step-by-step guide titled:

     > “How to Set Up and Use the Claude Memory Tool”
   * Include one working code snippet + short “when to use” table.

---

**Success criteria:**

* Easy for a beginner developer to follow.
* Clear setup instructions.
* Explains *why* and *when* to use memory and context editing.
* Includes one real-world example (EventOS or coding assistant).

---

✅ *Result:* Claude generates a simple, practical setup guide showing how to enable and use the **Memory Tool** (with context editing) to make agents that remember, learn, and improve across sessions.
