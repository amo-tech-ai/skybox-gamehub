## Quick Start

### Using the Skill
Read the skill file for reference:
```bash
cat /home/sk/medellin-spark/.claude/skills/prompt-engineer/SKILL.md
```

### Using the Agent

**Example 1: Create a new prompt**
```
User: "Create a prompt for analyzing customer feedback and categorizing it"

Agent: [Analyzes requirements, creates structured prompt with context,
        step-by-step instructions, and clear output format]
```

**Example 2: Optimize existing prompt**
```
User: "This prompt isn't working well: 'Write a report about sales'"

Agent: [Identifies issues (vague, no context, unclear format), creates
        improved version with context, structure, and examples]
```

**Example 3: Debug prompt issue**
```
User: "Claude keeps giving me verbose responses when I want concise ones"

Agent: [Identifies verbosity issue, adds explicit formatting constraints
        and style guidance using appropriate XML tags]
```

## Key Features

### 1. Clarity Optimization
Transforms vague prompts into clear, actionable instructions:
- Adds context and "why" explanations
- Specifies output format explicitly
- Provides sequential steps
- Includes aligned examples

### 2. Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
Implements three levels of CoT:
- Basic: "Think step-by-step"
- Guided: Specific thinking steps
- Structured: XML tags (`<thinking>`, `<answer>`)

### 3. Extended Thinking
Optimizes for Claude 4.5's extended thinking capabilities:
- General instructions first (not overly prescriptive)
- State management for long tasks
- Multi-context window workflows
- Context awareness patterns

### 4. Tool Use Optimization
Improves tool calling efficiency:
- Parallel tool call patterns
- Default-to-action vs. conservative modes
- Investigation before answering
- Grounding to reduce hallucinations

### 5. Production Patterns
Production-ready prompt templates:
- Agentic coding patterns
- Visual/frontend code generation
- Research and information gathering
- Document creation
- Code review and analysis

## Pattern Library

### Pattern: Basic Structured Prompt
```text
Your task is to [specific task] for [audience].

Context:
- Purpose: [why needed]
- Audience: [who uses this]
- Success: [what good looks like]

Instructions:
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]

Output format: [specification]
```

### Pattern: Chain-of-Thought
```text
[Task with context]

Think in <thinking> tags:
1. Analyze [aspect 1]
2. Consider [aspect 2]
3. Synthesize conclusion

Provide answer in <answer> tags.
```

### Pattern: Investigation
```text
<investigate_before_answering>
Never speculate about code you haven't opened.
Read relevant files BEFORE answering.
</investigate_before_answering>
```

### Pattern: Tool Use
```text
<default_to_action>
Implement changes rather than suggesting.
Infer user intent and proceed.
</default_to_action>

<use_parallel_tool_calls>
Make independent calls in parallel.
</use_parallel_tool_calls>
```

## Common Use Cases

### 1. System Prompts for AI Apps
**Task**: Create system prompts for AI-powered features
**Agent Action**: Analyzes requirements, creates structured system prompt with role definition, capabilities, constraints, and output format

### 2. Agent Instructions
**Task**: Write instructions for autonomous agents
**Agent Action**: Implements chain-of-thought, tool use patterns, state management, and self-correction guidelines

### 3. API Documentation Prompts
**Task**: Generate prompts for documentation creation
**Agent Action**: Creates prompts with investigation patterns, structured output, and example-driven instructions

### 4. Code Generation Prompts
**Task**: Optimize prompts for code generation
**Agent Action**: Adds specificity, aesthetic guidance, feature requests, and design principles

### 5. Research Prompts
**Task**: Create prompts for research and analysis
**Agent Action**: Implements extended thinking, structured approach, hypothesis tracking, and source verification

## Testing & Validation

### Checklist for Prompts
- [ ] Clear enough for someone with minimal context?
- [ ] Success criteria defined?
- [ ] Output format specified?
- [ ] Examples aligned with desired behavior?
- [ ] Necessary context included?
- [ ] Thinking structured (if needed)?
- [ ] Edge cases covered?
- [ ] Tone/style specified?

### Iteration Process
1. Start simple (basic instructions)
2. Test with examples
3. Analyze output
4. Refine (add structure, context, examples)
5. Retest
6. Optimize (remove unnecessary complexity)

## Examples

### Example 1: Before/After Simple Prompt

**Before**:
```text
Analyze this data
```

**After** (Agent-optimized):
```text
Your task is to analyze this sales data and provide actionable insights.

Context:
- Purpose: Quarterly review for executive team
- Audience: C-suite executives (non-technical)
- Success: Clear trends + 3 concrete recommendations

Instructions:
1. Identify top 3 trends in the data
2. Calculate key metrics: growth rate, top products, regional performance
3. Provide 3 specific, actionable recommendations

Output format:
<trends>
- [Trend 1 with supporting data]
- [Trend 2 with supporting data]
- [Trend 3 with supporting data]
</trends>

<metrics>
| Metric | Value | Change from Q2 |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| ... | ... | ... |
</metrics>

<recommendations>
1. [Recommendation 1 with rationale]
2. [Recommendation 2 with rationale]
3. [Recommendation 3 with rationale]
</recommendations>
```

### Example 2: Chain-of-Thought Addition

**Before**:
```text
Should we invest in Option A or Option B?
```

**After** (Agent-optimized with CoT):
```text
You're a financial advisor analyzing two investment options for a client.

Context:
- Client needs funds in 5 years for house down payment
- Option A: 12% historical returns, volatile
- Option B: 6% guaranteed returns, stable

Analyze in <thinking> tags:
1. Calculate potential returns for each option (5-year horizon)
2. Assess risk factors given the 5-year timeline
3. Consider client's risk tolerance (critical financial goal)
4. Evaluate historical volatility impact
5. Weigh certainty vs. potential upside

Provide your recommendation in <answer> tags:
- Clear recommendation (A or B)
- Justification based on analysis
- Specific numbers from calculations
```
